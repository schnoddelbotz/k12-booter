# I18N - Internationalization 

This Go package shall provide convinience tools to create
a translated app and provide basic I18N information to
the application using it. Ideas so far:

- wrap go-locale for locale detection, works cross-platform
- support automation of best practices in translation workflow
- provide blueprints for new projects aiming international user support
- provide a toy library for kids to play with basic geography knowledge
- this library shall not care about binary code size but clarity/readability of code
- Like the C# example, no database lookups shall be required for above tasks

It would be nice to know them ... and something about them?

## iso3166

The iso3166 binary around here somewhere can produce some basic Go maps from a Wikipedia article.
But the list feels incomplete. So we're putting this topic aside with a bad feeling. #ScopeCreep.
