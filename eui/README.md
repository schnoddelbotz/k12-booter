# eui - ebitenui

The code in this directory currently is a 1:1 copy of
[ebitenui](https://github.com/ebitenui/ebitenui) `demo` example code.

While the k12-booter terminal approach might work
well for most intended operations (and maybe even will, one day),
it's not suitable e.g. for the application catalog,
which is supposed to let users enjoy discovering the breadth
and capabilities of free open source software.
